      Install a world-class [PHP](http://php.net) development environment on your Mac. Unleash the speed of the webserver everybody is talking about, [Nginx](http://nginx.net). And for storage, use [Percona](http://percona.com), the most carefully maintained independent fork of the famous MySQL database, now owned by Oracle.
  #comparison
    %h2 Why should I use MNPP instead of MAMP?
    %p MAMP was a very good solution in the past. However, the Apache web server has lagged in terms of performance during the last few years. MNPP can handle much more requests per second than Apache with PHP implemented as a module.
    %p On the other side, MAMP uses MySQL which is now owned by Oracle. Although, Oracle still maintains a free, open source version of MySQL, they have been manipulating the product roadmap to keep most of the good stuff for the paid versions. Enters Percona. They decided to fork MySQL and have since been working on it under a different name, the Percona Server. Percona's roadmap is more promising and much more friendly with the open source community. Think of Percona as the MySQL we've all learned to love.
